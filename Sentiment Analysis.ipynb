    "#### 1. Positive Sentiment vs. Score:\n",
    "Since it is positive, it is as expected that reviews with higher scores (4 and 5) show increased positive sentiment (`pos` values), while lower-rated reviews (1 and 2) have minimal positive sentiment. This indicates that higher ratings reflect more positive language.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 2. Neutral Sentiment vs. Score:\n",
    "The Neutral sentiment is relatively consistent across the scores, especially high in reviews with a score of 1, 2, and 3. This suggests that even some low-rated reviews contain neutral or objective language, possibly indicating dissatisfaction without clear negativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Negative Sentiment vs. Score:\n",
    "The negative sentiment is prominent in reviews with a score of 1, aligning with expectations that the lowest-rated reviews are more negative. We can see that as the score increases, negative sentiment sharply decreases, with higher-rated reviews showing very little negativity. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compound Sentiment vs. Score:\n",
    "The compound score increases steadily with higher review scores, which reflects the overall sentiment. Reviews with a score of 1 have a negative compound value, while those rated 4 and 5 have significantly higher, positive compound scores. This really buttresses the effectiveness of the compound score in summarizing overall sentiment."

    "Performing this activity was insightful and practical. The process involved several important steps like text preprocessing for sentiment analysis, using `VADER` to extract sentiment scores, and visualizing results with `seaborn`. For each question i answered, it reinforced the importance of data cleaning and the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Additionally, analyzing sentiment scores against actual review ratings provided meaningful insight into customer feedback and product perception\n",

Learning to preprocess text, apply sentiment scoring, and visualize the results empowers data analysts to extract valuable insights from large datasets, which is essential in various fields like marketing, customer service, and product development.."
