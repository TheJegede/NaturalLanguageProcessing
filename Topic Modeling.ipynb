    "Working through this lab provided me with practical experience with key NLP techniques such as preprocessing which I've been doing since the first module, clustering, and topic modeling. Applying ESA to find related documents, in our case it was documents that had price, sugar and sweet and we could also see their similarities, and then using Agglomerative Clustering to visualize document relationships through dendrograms deepened my understanding of document similarity. Using LDA and NMF for topic modeling revealed hidden themes in the headlines, i saw how different the outputs were between LDA and NMF, which shows me how these algorithms can distill large text datasets into interpretable insights.\n",

    "### 2. A reflection on the importance of learning this activity.\n",
    "Learning these techniques is critical for us, because handling unstructured text data is abundant in real-world applications like customer feedback analysis, content categorization, and search optimization. The ability to preprocess, cluster, and extract topics from text helps build more intelligent systems, such as recommendation engines and information retrieval systems."
